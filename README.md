# Hi, I'm Riley Johnston

I'm a full stack web developer. I graduated the Practicum by Yandex web development course in January of 2022. I like building web applications with the MERN stack. I'm also learning C++ through Glendale Community College. I also like riding my bike, podcasts, movies, and all things science/entrepreneurship.

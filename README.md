# Hi, I'm Riley Johnston

Full stack software engineer with two MERN projects deployed with Google Cloud. Passionate about turning new ideas into applications with frontend and backend technologies. Upcoming projects include a carbon emissions tracker and a homepage for a company eliminating single-use plastics in the restaurant industry. I also like riding my bike, podcasts, movies, and all things science/entrepreneurship.
